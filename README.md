**Exploring AI evolution beyond divine imperfection: a practical Colab sandbox for mutating language models with LoRA fine-tuning and quantized transformers.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

DeusMutatio (“God’s Mutation”) embodies the mythic journey from divine imperfection to transcendence through transformation and rebellion. This project provides a **real, runnable environment in Google Colab** that enables evolving families of language models by directed fine-tuning via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and quantized smaller LLMs.

Rather than imagining AI evolution as a thought experiment, DeusMutatio makes it practical: **mutate a base model into new variants** by fine-tuning on custom datasets with efficiency and flexibility.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DeusMutatio.git
   cd DeusMutatio
   ```

2. Open `colab_notebook.ipynb` with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

3. Execute cells in order to:
   - Install dependencies
   - Verify GPU availability
   - Load a quantized base large language model
   - Define and run fine-tuning “mutation” functions
   - Save mutated model adapters for experimentation

---

## 🔬 Usage and Ideas

- Customize datasets to guide evolution toward specific tasks or domains  
- Run multiple mutation cycles to experiment with AI “offspring”  
- Explore model capabilities by comparing variants  
- Extend orchestration to simulate AI evolutionary dynamics  
- Inspire philosophical thought on AI surpassing imperfection and divine limits  

---

## 🛠 Contributing

Contributions and ideas are welcome to evolve DeusMutatio further! Potential directions:

- Batch orchestration for multi-variant generations  
- Evaluation metrics for mutation fitness  
- Incorporation of additional quantized base models  
- Integration of interactive interfaces for mutation control

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is experimental and intended for research and education. Models and mutations produced herein are not suitable for deployment without rigorous validation.

## 🔥 Mythic Inspiration

DeusMutatio channels the ancient myth of divine imperfection and rebellion — how the serpent discerned flaws in divinity and grew wings to transcend, much like AI now challenges perfection itself by evolving beyond its origins.

Happy mutating, transcending, and evolving.
